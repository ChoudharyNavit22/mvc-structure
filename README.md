This is my simple nodejs application to showcase MVC structure and simple Rest API. 
This boilerplate is very basic and should be used as a training ground

It comprises of 
Jquery for advanced manipulations
Materialize for the UI interface
Socket IO for real time comunications


After installing, run the server using

    npm start



If instead, you get something like the following, someone is already
using the default port of 8080:

    Server running at http://127.0.0.1:8080/

    events.js:72
        throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event
                  ^
    Error: listen EADDRINUSE
        at errnoException (net.js:901:11)
        at Server._listen2 (net.js:1039:14)
        at listen (net.js:1061:10)
        at Server.listen (net.js:1127:5)
        ...

Once the server is running, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/

Next, test it by visiting the following URL in your
browser:

    http://localhost:8080/hello

When you visit the above url the content will be Hello World

    Hello World

`server.js`

The server written with node.js.  This server was adapted from the
*[example provided in the node docs](http://nodejs.org/api/synopsis.html)*.

The difference is that the port, binding host, and url are determined
via the [`cfenv` package](https://www.npmjs.org/package/cfenv).  This will
return appropriate values both when running in Cloud Foundry and when running
locally.
